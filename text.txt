In this app I understood:
- how constraints work
- nested enumerations
- nested dictionaries
- two table views in one VC
- layout of apps is stored in XML format which you can edit in a source code 
(XML - layout language for apps: can be open with a browser/text editor/excel, HTML - for web pages: can be opened with broswer)
